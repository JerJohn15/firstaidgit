                        <p className="section-copy">First Aid Git started out as a dummy project while I was learning more on
                        using <a href="http://webpack.github.io">Webpack</a> with <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a>. Halfway through it I thought about making something
                        useful out of it, so I began to collect a few posts about the most frequently asked questions about git issues.</p>

                    <p className="section-copy">The motivation behind it was to have an easy and quick way to
                    search through the most common git-related issues when they arise, as I find myself having
                    dozens of Stackoverflow bookmarks scattered everywhere for these issues.</p>

                            <p className="section-copy">That's because it is messy! Since this wasn't meant to become a project
                            in the first place, I wasn't paying too much attention to its structure... so I will be cleaning up the code as the project is being maintained.</p>
